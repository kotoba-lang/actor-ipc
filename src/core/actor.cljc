  "Actor model: network-authoritative entity state. Restored from the legacy
  kami-engine/kami-core Rust crate's `src/actor.rs` (82 lines), deleted in
  kotoba-lang/kami-engine PR #82 \"Remove Rust workspace from kami-engine\", as
  part of the clj-wgsl migration (ADR-2607010930, com-junkawasaki/root).

  Original doc comment: \"Each Actor owns a hecs::World partition. Authority
  determines who is canonical. Actors communicate via Mailbox (KNP
  transport-agnostic).\"

  hecs-ECS-to-plain-map adaptation: the original `ActorId` referenced a
  `hecs::World`-partitioned `EntityId`. hecs's raw archetype/entity-storage
  internals are NOT ported (no CLJC equivalent) — per ADR-2607010930 and the
  sibling `kotoba-lang/scene-graph` restoration, entities are represented as
  plain integer IDs (`core/entity-id?`) keyed into ordinary CLJC maps rather than
  a native ECS. The `components` submodule below (originally `#[repr(C)]`
  `bytemuck::Pod` GPU-layout structs) becomes plain CLJC maps with keyword keys;
  there is no GPU-buffer memory layout to preserve in portable CLJC.")

;; --- Authority -------------------------------------------------------------
;; Rust: `pub enum Authority { Server, Client, Predicted }`
;; Who owns the canonical state for this actor.
(def authority-values

  :server    — Server is canonical (economy, HP, inventory).
  :client    — Client is canonical (camera, input).
  :predicted — Client predicts, server reconciles (position, animation)."
  #{:server :client :predicted})

;; --- ActorType ---------------------------------------------------------
;; Rust: `#[repr(u8)] pub enum ActorType { Player = 0, Npc = 1, Item = 2,
;;         Projectile = 3, Vehicle = 4, Trigger = 5, World = 6 }`
;; Actor type determines which components are attached.
